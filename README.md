## About This Project

This repository provides a structured path for learning Python through 30 carefully organized Jupyter notebooks, progressing from basic syntax to advanced topics including data science and AI/ML fundamentals.

**What You'll Find:**

- **Clear Learning Path:** 30 notebooks organized across 6 progressive sections
- **Hands-On Learning:** Interactive code examples and practice exercises
- **Modern Python:** Current best practices and real-world applications
- **Comprehensive Scope:** From Python basics through AI/ML introductions

## Quick Start (Pick ONE path)

### 1. Fastest (just look & run a first notebook)

You only need Python 3.11+ installed.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JawadFarooqi/python-playground.git
cd python-playground
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\\Scripts\\activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install notebook
jupyter notebook
```

Then open `notebooks/` and start with `01_getting_started.ipynb`.

### 2. Recommended (with helper tools & tests)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JawadFarooqi/python-playground.git
cd python-playground
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -e .[dev]  # install package + dev tools
pre-commit install      # optional: auto-fix style on commit
jupyter notebook
```

### 3. One-liner (using uv â€” optional fast resolver)

If you have `uv` installed:

```bash
uv sync --all-extras
uv run jupyter notebook
```

If you only want to browse notebooks online (no install), you will later be able to use an nbviewer or Binder badge (coming soon).

> New to virtual environments? Think of `.venv` as a private folder where this project keeps its own tools so they don't clash with other projects.

## Why this project?

Most beginner resources mix too many ideas at once or hide important basics. This repository aims to provide:

- A clear sequential learning path
- Small, fast, reproducible notebooks
- Explicit learning objectives & exercises
- Clean code & modern tooling (Ruff, Black, Pytest)

## Quick Start (Pick ONE path)

### 1. Fastest (just look & run a first notebook)
You only need Python 3.11+ installed.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/JawadFarooqi/python-playground.git
cd python-playground
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\\Scripts\\activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install notebook
jupyter notebook
```
Then open `notebooks/` and start with `00_index.ipynb` (will appear once added).

### 2. Recommended (with helper tools & tests)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/JawadFarooqi/python-playground.git
cd python-playground
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -e .[dev]  # install package + dev tools
pre-commit install      # optional: auto-fix style on commit
jupyter notebook
```

### 3. One-liner (using uv â€” optional fast resolver)
If you have `uv` installed:
```bash
uv sync --all-extras
uv run jupyter notebook
```

If you only want to browse notebooks online (no install), you will later be able to use an nbviewer or Binder badge (coming soon).

> New to virtual environments? Think of `.venv` as a private folder where this project keeps its own tools so they don't clash with other projects.

## Repository Layout (early stage)

```
src/playground/    # Reusable helper utilities imported by notebooks
notebooks/         # Learning tracks (to be populated)
tests/             # Pytest-based tests (unit + future notebook smoke tests)
docs/              # Documentation site sources
.github/           # CI workflows, issue templates, PR template
```

## Notebook Format Standard

Each notebook begins with:

- Title
- Learning Objectives (3â€“5)
- Prerequisites (links)
- Estimated Time
- Key Terms

Ends with:

- Summary
- Exercises (difficulty â˜… to â˜…â˜…â˜…)
- Further Reading

## Contributing

See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for full guidelines. PRs welcomeâ€”especially improvements to clarity, exercises, and tests.

## Roadmap (Short-Term)

- [ ] Add `00_index.ipynb` with welcome + how to use this repo
- [ ] Populate first basics notebooks (variables, types, printing)
- [ ] Add notebook execution tests (smoke subset)
- [ ] Publish docs site (MkDocs + notebook gallery)
- [ ] Add exercises + solution reveal pattern
- [ ] Provide Binder / Codespaces buttons

## License

GPL-3.0-only (see `LICENSE`). If you prefer a more permissive license (MIT/Apache) for broader reuse, open a discussion.

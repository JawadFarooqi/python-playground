## Why this project?

Most beginner resources mix too many ideas at once or hide important basics. This repository aims to provide:

- A clear sequential learning path
- Small, fast, reproducible notebooks
- Explicit learning objectives & exercises
- Clean code & modern tooling (Ruff, Black, Pytest)

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JawadFarooqi/python-playground.git
cd python-playground
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\\Scripts\\activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install .[dev]
pre-commit install
```

Open notebooks in your preferred environment (VS Code, JupyterLab) from the `notebooks/` directory.

## Repository Layout

```
src/playground/    # Reusable helper utilities imported by notebooks
notebooks/         # Learning tracks (to be populated)
tests/             # Pytest-based tests (unit + future notebook smoke tests)
docs/              # Documentation site sources
.github/           # CI workflows, issue templates, PR template
```

## Notebook Format Standard

Each notebook begins with:

- Title
- Learning Objectives (3â€“5)
- Prerequisites (links)
- Estimated Time
- Key Terms

Ends with:

- Summary
- Exercises (difficulty â˜… to â˜…â˜…â˜…)
- Further Reading

## Contributing

See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for full guidelines. PRs welcomeâ€”especially improvements to clarity, exercises, and tests.

## Roadmap (Short-Term)

- [ ] Populate initial 10 notebooks (basics & control flow)
- [ ] Add notebook execution tests
- [ ] Publish docs site (MkDocs)
- [ ] Add exercises + solution reveal pattern

## License

GPL-3.0-only (see `LICENSE`). If you prefer a more permissive license (MIT/Apache) for broader reuse, open a discussion.

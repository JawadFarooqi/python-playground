### 🎓 Digital Certificates
Generate personalized certificates showing:
- Your name and completion date
- Progress statistics
- Earned achievement badges
- Section-by-section breakdown

## Quick Start

```python
from certificates.progress_tracker import ProgressTracker, generate_certificate

# Create your progress tracker
tracker = ProgressTracker("Your Name")

# Mark notebooks as complete
tracker.mark_complete(1)  # Completed notebook 1
tracker.mark_complete(2)  # Completed notebook 2

# Check your progress
progress = tracker.get_progress()
print(f"You're {progress['total_progress']['percentage']:.1f}% complete!")

# See your badges
badges = tracker.get_earned_badges()
for badge in badges:
    print(f"🏅 {badge}")

# Generate certificate
certificate_path = generate_certificate(tracker)
print(f"Certificate saved to: {certificate_path}")
```

## Usage in Notebooks

Add this to the end of each notebook to track your progress:

```python
# Track your progress (optional)
try:
    from certificates.progress_tracker import ProgressTracker
    
    # Update with your name
    tracker = ProgressTracker("Your Name Here")
    
    # Mark this notebook as complete (change number for each notebook)
    tracker.mark_complete(1)  # This is notebook 1
    
    print("✅ Notebook completed!")
    print(f"Progress: {tracker.get_progress()['total_progress']['percentage']:.1f}% complete")
    
    # Show any new badges
    badges = tracker.get_earned_badges()
    if badges:
        print("🏅 Your badges:", ", ".join(badges[-3:]))  # Show latest 3
        
except ImportError:
    print("✅ Notebook completed! (Progress tracking not available)")
```

## Demo

Run the demo to see the system in action:

```bash
cd certificates
python progress_tracker.py
```

This generates a sample certificate showing how the system works.

## Certificate Examples

Certificates are saved as text files with beautiful ASCII art formatting. They include:

- Personal information and completion date
- Overall progress statistics  
- List of earned achievement badges
- Section-by-section progress breakdown
- Links to continue learning

## Customization

You can extend the system by:

- Adding new achievement badges
- Customizing certificate templates
- Creating progress visualizations
- Adding section-specific certificates
- Integrating with learning management systems

## Privacy

All progress tracking is local to your computer. No data is shared or uploaded anywhere unless you choose to share your certificates.
